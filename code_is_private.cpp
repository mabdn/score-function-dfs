// The code I wrote in this project is private. 
// It is actively used by the KA-RaceIng team.
// It is the core of path planning at KA-RaceIng and is essential for the team's success in autonomous racing. 
// Hence, I cannot publish any of this code here. 

// I can give you more insights and show you code in a personal discussion, though.
